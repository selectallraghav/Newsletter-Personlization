# Loan Letter Generation System

## Overview

This project is designed to automate the generation of personalized loan offer letters using customer demographic data and machine learning model output. The system dynamically creates HTML-based loan offer letters, customized for each customer, by merging customer data with a pre-defined loan template.

## Features

- **Personalized Loan Offers**: Generates personalized loan offer letters for customers based on demographic information and model predictions.
- **HTML Email Templates**: Uses a pre-defined HTML template with placeholders for customer-specific information like loan amount, interest rate, and other bank details.
- **Custom Loan Images**: Loan images are selected dynamically based on the customer's gender, marital status, and loan type.
- **Bank Branding**: Customizable bank branding with logo, contact details, and footer information.

### Files:

- **home_loan_template.html**: This is the HTML template for the loan letter. It includes placeholders that will be replaced with customer-specific data, such as loan details and bank information.
- **generate_loan_letters.py**: Python script that loads customer demographic data and model output, merges them, selects the appropriate loan image, and generates personalized loan letters in HTML format.
- **customerDemographics.csv**: Sample CSV file containing customer demographic information such as Customer ID, Name, Gender, Marital Status, etc.
- **model_output_data.csv**: Sample CSV file containing the model's predictions and customer response data.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/loan-letter-generation.git
cd loan-letter-generation
```

### Step 2: Install Required Dependencies

Install the required Python libraries by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` file should include the necessary packages, such as:

```
pandas
jinja2
```

### Step 3: Prepare Your Data

Ensure that you have the following files in the same directory:

- **customerDemographics.csv**: Contains the demographic data of customers.
- **model_output_data.csv**: Contains the model's output, including whether the customer accepted the loan offer (`customer_response_in_binary`).

### Step 4: Update Template and Bank Information

Edit the `home_loan_template.html` file to update any placeholders with actual bank information, logos, or branding specifics.

- **bank_logo_path**: Path to your bank's logo image.
- **bank_name**: Name of the bank.
- **bank_street, bank_city, bank_state, bank_zip**: Address of the bank.
- **bank_phone, bank_email, bank_website**: Contact details for the bank.

### Step 5: Run the Script

Execute the Python script to generate personalized loan offer letters:

```bash
python generate_loan_letters.py
```

The generated HTML files will be saved in the `generated_template/` folder, with filenames in the format `generated_home_loan_{Customer_ID}.html`.

## How It Works

1. **Data Loading**: The Python script loads customer data from the `customerDemographics.csv` and `model_output_data.csv` files.
2. **Data Merging**: It filters the customer responses and merges the model output with the demographic data using the `Customer_ID` field.
3. **Loan Image Selection**: Based on the customer's gender and marital status, the script selects an appropriate loan image (e.g., Family Auto Loan, Male Home Loan, etc.).
4. **HTML Generation**: The `generate_loan_letters.py` script uses the Jinja2 templating engine to render personalized loan offer letters using the provided HTML template.
5. **Output**: The generated HTML files are stored in the `generated_template/` directory.

## Example Output

Each generated loan letter contains the following:

- **Personalized Email Body**: A custom message addressing the customer with loan details.
- **Loan Information**: Includes the loan amount, interest rate, loan term, and monthly payment.
- **Bank Information**: Displays the bank’s logo, contact details, and website.
- **Loan Image**: A dynamically chosen image based on the customer's profile.

### Optional Enhancements

- **Email Sending Integration**: You could extend the project by adding functionality to send these generated HTML files as emails using libraries like `smtplib`.
- **Dynamic Loan Types**: Modify the template and Python code to support different types of loans (auto, personal, business, etc.).
